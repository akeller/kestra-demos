Nothing to see here (yet).

## Notes
Slack plugin for IncomingWebHook has two similarly looking properties, `messageText` and `payload`. `messageText` will handle markdown without escaping. Should shift or prioritize most examples to use these propery vs. `payload`. 

## Third-party platforms
* GitHub
* Google Workspace (Calendar)

### Separate, personal instances
* Confluence
